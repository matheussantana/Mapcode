Different types of mapping between a template and the generated code are identified, each one covering a different code generation possibility. The mapping is established by the automatic insertion, in the generated code, of special markings that delineate the boundaries of each mapping type.\r\n\r\nCreated by: \r\n\r\n    Matheus Santana\r\n    (matheus santana <at> comp <dot> ufscar <dot> br)\r\n    UFSCar, Federal University of São Carlos, Brazil\r\n    Computer Departament\r\n    Center of Exact Sciences and Technology\r\n    http://www2.comp.ufscar.br/~matheus_santana/\r\n\r\n\r\nFor futher information see:\r\n\r\n[Project website] (http://matheussantana.github.com/Mapcode/)\r\n\r\n[Code repository] (https://github.com/matheussantana/Mapcode)\r\n\r\n[More info] (http://www2.comp.ufscar.br/~matheus_santana/static.php?page=static120821-224438)\r\n\r\n## Mapcode Tags\r\n\r\nOne custom tag was created for each of the seven mapping types\r\ndescribed earlier.\r\n\r\n*   \\<mbct:copy\\>: simple copy;\r\n*   \\<mbct:get\\>: simple substitution;\r\n*   \\<mbct:set\\>: variable attribution, used in indirect substitution;\r\n*   \\<mbct:if\\>: conditional;\r\n*   \\<mbct:iterate\\>: repetition;\r\n*   \\<mbct:include\\>: inclusion of another template; and\r\n*   \\<mbct:file\\>: creation of a new output file.\r\n\r\nThe new tags reproduce the behavior of their corresponding original tags. Forexample, <m:if> works in the same way as <c:if>. But the new tags also generate annotations (Java comments) that mark relevant code locations, according to each mapping type. For example, the tag <m:copy> copies a piece of code from the template to the generated code, and automatically inserts a comment in the beginning and end. The tag <m:iterate> implements repetition, marking the beginning and end of thegenerated code, and also the start of each iteration. Figure 9 shows these two examples.\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://www2.comp.ufscar.br/~matheus_santana/images/mapcode/mapcode.png \"Mapcode mapping types\")\r\n\r\n\r\nFor type 1, the inserted comment (//T1:templ1.jet#1) indicates the type of mapping (T1), the template that generated this piece of code (templ1.jet), and a unique identifier (number 1 after character #). For type 4, similar comments surround the generated code (//T4:templ2.jet#1). In addition, other comments (//T4:i=1,\r\n//T4:i=2 and //T4:i=3) mark the places where each iteration starts.\r\n\r\nWith the new tags, it is possible to generate exactly the same type of code as with the original tags, but with the side effect that now the generated code is completely annotated, and the mapping between generated code and the templates is established.\r\n\r\nThe result is that, for each piece of generated code, it is possible to identify the mapping type, the template that generated this particular piece of code and even which part of the template was responsible for it, by locating the nearest surrounding generated comments. Code migration can be made based on this information.\r\n\r\n##What is JET?##\r\n\r\nJET is typically used in the implementation of a \"code generator\". A code-generator is an important component of Model Driven Development (MDD). The goal of MDD is to describe a software system using abstract models (such as EMF/ECORE models or UML models), and then refine and transform these models into code. Although is possible to create abstract models, and manually transform them into code, the real power of MDD comes from automating this process. Such transformations accelerate the MDD process, and result in better code quality. The transformations can capture the \"best practices\" of experts, and can ensure that a project consistently employes these practices.
