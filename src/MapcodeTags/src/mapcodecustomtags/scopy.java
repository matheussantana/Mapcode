Mapcode - Mapping Generated Code to a Reference Implementation â€“ Towards Automatic Code Migration

This plugin implements an initial step towards automatic code migration in the context of MDE-based
projects that use template-based code generation (Java Emitter Templates(JET) engine) backed up by
a reference implementation. Different types of mapping between a template and the generated code
are identified, each one covering a different code generation possibility.
The mapping is established by the automatic insertion, in the generated code, of special
markings that delineate the boundaries of each mapping type.
